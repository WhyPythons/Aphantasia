Combat:
Add menu
[Attack]
[Skills]
[Bag]
[Run]
This is game is gonna have a focus on combat so, building my mechanics around a combat menu seems like a good idea.
So first things first [Bag] or items really, the most important part of this game is gonna be skills and items, with items being
number one on the totem pole. 
So first i have to make a equip/unequip system, an inventory, equip slots, the items themselves, which i will have be randomly generated
like damage and name and all that, within the level range of course.
