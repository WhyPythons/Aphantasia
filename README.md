# Aphantasia
An rpg-esque project, inspired by a korean web-comic called "Pick Me Up, Infinite Gacha".

Data-driven using json. Made entirely in python, using minimal outside libraries.

This being the third iteration of my first ever game project (A mess that should've never seen the light of day), with a clearer vision and skills to go along with it.

This read-me will be expanded when the game has reached a good enough point to explain further.
